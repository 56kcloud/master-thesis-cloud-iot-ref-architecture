This master's thesis would not have been written over five months without the support of a number of people. It's time to thank all these contributors, whether they are closely involved in the project or are far removed from the digital world.

\begin{itemize}
    \item [•] First of all, I would like to thank my family and especially my parents, without whom I wouldn't be able to fulfil all my dreams. So I'm always able to fulfil my potential in my daily life. It's the strength of spirit I've inherited that will always enable me to move forward despite the obstacles I encounter.
    \item [•] Secondly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Mr Fabien Vannel, who was always at my complete disposal. He was able to provide me with invaluable advice throughout the work to achieve the desired result.
    \item [•] Finally, I would like to thank everyone at \nameref{subsec:56k.cloud}. They are a great team, bringing joy and good humour to the organisation. What's more, they were able to contribute their knowledge when obstacles were encountered.
\end{itemize}
