Cloud-Native IoT Reference Architecture with Arm SystemReady is an open-source project designed to meet the integration challenges between embedded systems and the cloud. This architecture facilitates the automatic provisioning of a cloud infrastructure and the integration of a fleet of embedded systems during their initial start-up. Designed for use with AWS, it focuses on core components while leveraging Arm processors and SystemReady certifications. The project aims to streamline collaboration between embedded systems engineers and cloud professionals, allowing them to focus on their end products. By following Cloud-Native best practices, the continuous integration and delivery tools ensure a robust, functional architecture on various Arm-based and SystemReady-certified embedded systems. The ultimate aim is to encourage the creation of a community around this architecture, enabling engineers to adopt it and apply it easily to their projects. In addition, a demonstration is included involving the deployment of a cloud infrastructure on AWS and the automatic configuration of cloud services for seamless interaction with an embedded system, plus data visualisation accessible via a web interface.
